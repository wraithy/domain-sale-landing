# domain-sale-landing
A simple landing page; perfect for selling your domains.

# How to setup

1. Download the source and edit the `includes/config.php` file by filling it with your information.
2. Upload the files to your hosting provider and set up your web server.
3. Point your domain(s) to your web server.

# Things to note

Make sure that...

* Your hosting provider allows emails to be sent out via SMTP (some providers disable this to prevent spam).
* Your web server is set up so that it directs all of the domains that you are trying to sell to the folder holding the uploaded source.
* You have PHP installed (should be obvious but you never know).

I was looking for a simple landing page to sell a few domains and came across a couple however I wasn't happy with a few things and decided to make my own. Some of the code used in this project was taken from the repo linked below along with the main design (although I have re-written it).

**Inspired by:** https://github.com/saroz/domain-for-sale

This project uses **PHPMailer** for sending emails and I have only included the files that are required.
